Hi ! I'm <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/fadlizakaria">Zakaria Fadli</a>

Welcome to my Neovim configuration!

This configuration is designed to be used with Neovim 0.5.0 or later.

On my day to day I use Neovim for C/C++, Python, and Lua development.

## Approach

### Lua first

Lua fist approach, with a almost no vimscript.

### Modularity

Plugin configurations are separated into their own files.

### Reasonable Minimalism

Only the necessary plugins are installed. But this config is still made for modern desktop machines.
Not minimalist enough for an embedded Linux editor.

## Main features

### Efficient code navigation

- Telescope for fuzzy finding files and grepping
- Use TAGS file for code navigation (Automatically generated by Vim-Gutentags)
  - LSP code navigation is also available but not always reliable.
- Uses Ripgrep for grepping

### LSP support

Language Server Protocol support for C/C++, Python, and Lua.
Very good for real time code linting/analysis and completion.

I use `trouble.nvim` to show the diagnostics in a nice way.

#### C/C++

Uses Clangd as LSP server.

Uses `clang-tidy` for code linting. As long as you have .clang-tidy config file in your project root, it will be used.
Can check many things, such as if you C++ is modern enough ;)

- [ ] TODO: Add clang-format support

#### Python

Uses Pyright as LSP server.

#### Lua

Uses Sumneko as LSP server.
I use this doe

### Remembering keybindings

How do i rememeber all the keybindings? I don't.
I use whichkey to show me all the keybindings for the current mode.

### Git integration

- Mainly use `TIG` for git operations
- Gitsigns for showing git diff in the gutter
- [ ] Add ]g and [g for navigating git diff hunks

### File explorer

- Nvim-tree does the job

### Autocompletion

- uses `nvim-cmp` for autocompletion.
- LSP based completion
- Snippets support
- Copilot (AI based completion, disabled by default)

# Generative AI

- Copilot (Disabled by default), Enable with `:CopilotEnable` or keymap `<leader>cp`
  (risk of IP leakage, refer to https://copilot.github.com/ for more info)
- ChatGPT, does not read your code, but can be talked to using prompts.
